## Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)

CPCT is capable of analyzing a certificateâ€™s conformance to a pre-defined certificate profile. User input consists of a certificate and a profile selection. After processing the certificate, CPCT outputs a table similar in formatting to the certificate format tables often included in Certificate Profile documents, but including additional analysis content indicating PASS or specific text describing the non-conformance.

The tool is capable of analyzing certificates for conformance with the FPKI profiles described in the documents available on the [Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) web page](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/fpki/)
